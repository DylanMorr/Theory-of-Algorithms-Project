    "In this notebook I will be exploring the Polynomial Time Complexity Class (P). Complexity classes allow scientists to solve problems and work how much resources are required to get the solution. All these problems are broken up into different classes depending on their results, in this notebook we will look further into the class P. The class P is used for solving decision problems, these are problems that require a yes or no answer. The problems within class P are said to be 'efficiently solvable', this are exceptions to this statement both in and out of the P class, but for the majority of problems in P this is the case.

We then say M accepts w if the computation ends in the accepted state. It can also fail if M fails to accept w by the computation ending, it going into a rejected state, or the computation failing to terminate. The language that can be accepted in M, denoted L(M),  with associated alphabet Σ can be defined as follows [3]:\n",
