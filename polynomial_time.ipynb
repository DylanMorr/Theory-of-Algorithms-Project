All these problems are broken up into different classes depending on their results, in this notebook we will look further into the class P. The class P is used for solving decision problems, these are problems that require a yes or no answer. The problems within class P are said to be 'efficiently solvable', there are exceptions to this statement both in and out of the P class, but for the majority of problems in P this is the case.

    "All the elements in class P are languages. If we say Σ is a finite alphabet with at least two elements and set Σ∗ to the set of finite strings over Σ. The language that is over  Σ is a subset L of Σ∗.\n",
    "So then we'll say each Turing Machine M has a related input alphabet Σ. So for each string w in Σ∗ we say a computation related to M with input w. We then say M accepts w if the computation ends in the accepted state. It can also fail if M fails to accept w by the computation ending, or if it goes into a rejected state, or the computation failing to terminate. The language that can be accepted in M, denoted L(M),  with associated alphabet Σ can be defined as follows [3]:\n",

    "#### Hungarian Maximum Matching\n",
    "- The Hungarian matching algorithm, also known as the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm, is an algorithm used to find maximum-weight matchings in bipartite graphs.\n",
    "- It is a O(∣V∣3) algorithm.\n",
    "- These graphs can easily be represented using an adjacency matrix where the weights of the edges are the entries.\n",
    "- There following diagram shows the adjacency matrix representation [4]:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/hung-match.png\" align=\"center\" width=\"300\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Hungarian algorithm operates on the key idea that \"if a number is added or subtracted from all of the entries of any one row or column of a cost matrix, then an optimal assignment for the resulting cost matrix is also an optimal assignment for the original cost matrix\"[4].\n",
    "- The method works as follows:\n",
    "\t1. Subtract the smallest entry in each row from all the other entries in the row. Making the smallest entry in the row now equal to 0.\n",
    "\t2. Subtract the smallest entry in each column from all the other entries in the column. Making the smallest entry in the column now equal to 0.\n",
    "\t3. Draw lines through the row and columns that have the 0 entries such that the fewest lines possible are drawn.\n",
    "\t4. If there are n lines drawn, an optimal assignment of zeros is possible and the algorithm is finished. If the number of lines is less than n, then the optimal number of zeros is not yet reached. Go to the next step.\n",

    "You are having a party and you want a musician to perform, a chef to prepare food, and a cleaning service to help clean up after the party. There are three companies that provide each of these three services, but one company can only provide one service at a time (i.e. Company A cannot provide both the cleaners and the chef). You are deciding which company you should purchase each service from in order to minimize the cost of the party.

    "What are Polynomial-Time Reductions:\n",
    "- A polynomial time reduction is a way of solving a problem by using another problem.\n",
    "- It does this by checking if one problem has a hypothetical subroutine solving the second problem, if it does have this the first problem can be solved by reducing it to inputs for the second problem and calling the subroutine.\n",
    "- If the time required to convert the first problem to the second, and the number of times the subroutine is called are polynomial, this means the first problem is polynomial-time reducible to the second.\n",
    "- This proves that the both problems are the same difficulty to solve because whenever an effective algorithm exists for the second problem, one exists for the first one too.\n",
    "- This is also the same for the other way around, if no effective algorithm exists for the first, none exist for the second. [8]\n",
    "\n",
    "Many-One Reductions [8]:\n",
    "- The many-one reduction is a polynomial-time algorithm for converting inputs from one problem into inputs to another problem, so that the converted problem will have the same outputs as the original one.\n",
    "- If we take two problems, problem A and problem B, we can solve the instance x of A by doing the above conversion to give us the instance y of B, this gives y as the input to the algorithm for B and giving us an output.\n",
    "- This type of reduction is denoted as follows: <img src=\"img/many-one.PNG\" align=\"center\" width=\"150\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Truth-Table Reductions [8]:\n",
    "- The truth-table reduction is a polynomial-time algorithm used for converting inputs to a problem to a fixed number of inputs for another problem, so that the outputs of the first problem can be expressed as a function for the outputs of the second problem.\n",
    "- The function that maps the outputs for the second problem into the outputs of the first problem must be the same for all the inputs.\n",
    "- This type of reduction is denoted as follows: <img src=\"img/truth.PNG\" align=\"center\" width=\"80\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Turing Reductions [8]:\n",
    "- The Turing reduction is an algorithm that solves a problem using a polynomial number of calls to a subroutine for a second problem.\n",
    "- This reduction is also known as the Cook reduction which is named after Stephen Cook.\n",
    "- This type of reduction is denoted as follow: <img src=\"img/turing.PNG\" align=\"center\" width=\"80\"/>\n",
    "- The many-one reduction is related to this reduction but is more restricted."

    "- These two categories of problems hold the majority of common problems in the complexity theory field.\n",
    "- The main problem with these is if a computer that validates a solution quickly for a difficult problem can also get the solution itself.\n",
    "- The solution to the P problems can be solved and validated quickly by computers.\n",
    "- While solutions to NP problems are fast to validate but extremely slow to solve.\n",
    "- A more formal way of describing theses problems is, P can be solved using the abstract model of deterministic Turing machines.\n",
    "- These problems take a polynomial amount of space known of polynomial-space or PSPACE.\n",
    "- While NP problems are solved using non-deterministic Turing machines.\n",
    "- These problems are in the complexity space non-deterministic polynomial space  or NPSPACE.\n",
    "- In the current status of research many believe that P probably doesn't equal NP.\n",
    "- This problem is extremely important for research into the further understanding of computational complexity.\n",
