All these problems are broken up into different classes depending on their results, in this notebook we will look further into the class P. The class P is used for solving decision problems, these are problems that require a yes or no answer. The problems within class P are said to be 'efficiently solvable', there are exceptions to this statement both in and out of the P class, but for the majority of problems in P this is the case.

We then say M accepts w if the computation ends in the accepted state. It can also fail if M fails to accept w by the computation ending, or if it goes into a rejected state, or the computation failing to terminate. The language that can be accepted in M, denoted L(M),  with associated alphabet Σ can be defined as follows [3]:\n",

    "#### Hungarian Maximum Matching\n",
    "- The Hungarian matching algorithm, also known as the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm, is an algorithm used to find maximum-weight matchings in bipartite graphs.\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/hung-match.PNG\" align=\"center\" width=\"300\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Hungarian algorithm operates on the key idea that \"if a number is added or subtracted from all of the entries of any one row or column of a cost matrix, then an optimal assignment for the resulting cost matrix is also an optimal assignment for the original cost matrix\"[4].\n",
    "- The method works as follows:\n",
    "\t1. Subtract the smallest entry in each row from all the other entries in the row. Making the smallest entry in the row now equal to 0.\n",
    "\t2. Subtract the smallest entry in each column from all the other entries in the column. Making the smallest entry in the column now equal to 0.\n",
    "\t3. Draw lines through the row and columns that have the 0 entries such that the fewest lines possible are drawn.\n",
    "\t4. If there are n lines drawn, an optimal assignment of zeros is possible and the algorithm is finished. If the number of lines is less than n, then the optimal number of zeros is not yet reached. Go to the next step.\n",

There are three companies that provide each of these three services, but one company can only provide one service at a time (i.e. Company A cannot provide both the cleaners and the chef).
