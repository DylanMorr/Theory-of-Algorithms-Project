# Theory of Algorithms Project 2023

This is my project work for the Theory of Algorithms module in Software Development in ATU Galway.

***

## Module Details & Assessment
In this module we had to explore the topic of the Polynomial Time Class (P). The Polynomial class is part of the complexity classes which allow scientists to solve problems and work out how many resources are required to get the solution. All these problems are broken up into different classes depending on their results, in this notebook I focus on class P. The class P is used for solving decision problems, these are problems that require a yes or no answer. The problems within class P are said to be ‘efficiently solvable’, there are exceptions to this statement both in and out of the P class, but for the majority of problems in P this is the case.

## Discussion Topics 
I looked at 5 different topics in this notebook:
- Definition
- Notable Projects
- Polynomial Time Algorithms
- Reductions
- P versus NP Problem

***

Definition: <br>
In this section I looked what the class P is by looking at an informal and formal characterization.

Notable Projects: <br>
In this section I looked at two of the most popular projects associated with the class P, the Hungarian Maximum Matching problem and AKS Primality Test. I’ll look at what they are and in the following section Polynomial Time Algorithms I test algorithms in python to see how they perform.

Polynomial Time Algorithms: <br>
In this section I explore two algorithms, the Hungarian Algorithm and the AKS Primality Test. I implement both of these algorithms in Python and get results for both.

Reductions: <br>
In this section I had a look at what polynomial-time reductions are, and researched the three main types of polynomial time reductions, Many-One Reductions, Truth-Table Reductions, and Turing Reductions.

P versus NP Problem: <br>
In this section I researched what the P vs NP problem is all about. I found out what the problem is all about and what it means to the field of computing if it was to be solved. I also looked at what lies ahead for this problem.
